We'll appriciatet it when you add a version of translation of readme or torturials. And in order to make it more convenient for the reader, please mention the following points when translate:

- Please not the version of source code which this translate is attached to.
- Please respect other people all around the world do not add anything about religion and politics to it. This repo is only for coding development and open source, not for any other things.
- James Ummex is a busy person without much free time. So really sorry that there might be no response to your pull request for really a long time.
